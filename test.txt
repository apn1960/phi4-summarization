Nearly four years late, City of Ithaca completes 2021 audit

ITHACA, N.Y. — Nearly four years after it was originally due, the City of Ithaca has a completed audit for fiscal year 2021.

It’s a step in the right direction for the city, which has struggled to catch up on a backlog of financial filings — an issue that has drawn public concern and criticism to City Hall after it caused the ratings agency Moody’s to withdraw Ithaca’s credit rating in March 2024.

Common Council unanimously voted to accept the 2021 audit after receiving a presentation on the audit from Duane Shoen, a partner at Insero & Co., the firm that conducted the audit. 

Despite the marginal progress, some members of Ithaca’s Common Council expressed frustration over the limited insight they could draw from a four–year-old audit.

“The frustrating and difficult thing for me when reading through this is that it brings up so many questions that I know cannot be answered by this document because we’re now four years behind,” Alderperson Patrick Kuehl said. “These numbers aren’t even accurate anymore.”

Kuehl’s remark kicked off a back and forth between him and Shoen over the contents of the audit and the issues that contributed to the delays.

As has been previously reported, Shoen explained that the fault of the delay largely rests on the city’s shoulders. He told council members that Insero & Co. would request information from the city controller’s office and, after receiving a response acknowledging the request, wait for weeks for the information to be sent. 

“Weeks would go by and we wouldn’t hear anything,” Shoen said. “Every so often we would reach out again and say, ‘Hey, we’re still waiting for this and this and this.’ But it took a long time to get stuff.”

As concern over the city’s delayed financial reporting has mounted over the last year and a half, city officials have emphasized that the city’s finances are healthy despite the process issues behind the late audits.

The audit discussed on Wednesday verified that claim from city officials, at least for fiscal year 2021.

Shoen said, “I hesitate to go into a lot of detail about the numbers, because they are quite late at this point but […] other than the fact that they are quite late, the financial statements are pretty good.”

The city’s managed to whittle down its outstanding debt by about $2.4 million, bringing that figure to $120.5 million, according to the audit. The city’s general fund balance increased by almost $6 million during 2021, bringing the total to about $16.5 million by the end of 2021. The total fund balance rose to about $50 million, marking a $10.5 increase from the end of 2020.

The audit also further revealed issues in the city’s accounting practices, which contributed to the lengthy delay.

Shoen described “pretty significant formula errors” in the 2021 audit, which caused the city to need large adjustments in the accounting of its fixed assets. 

Fixed assets were tracked in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, instead of through the city’s accounting software, which the audit noted created “greater opportunity for error.” The accounting software the city used apparently did not allow for fixed asset accounting, according to the audit.

Auditors recommended that a corrective action plan be implemented, and that any review of the city systems be documented by the city administration.

Insero & Co. noted in its audit that the ongoing personnel challenges in the city controller’s office has contributed factors that make the financial reporting more difficult, such as errors in general ledger balances.

The search for a permanent new city controller has dragged on after long-time City Controller Steve Thayer retired at the end of 2023. Multiple failed searches have left the city without a permanent department head. The role is currently filled by Acting City Controller Wendy Cole, who has worked for the city since 2017, according to her LinkedIn profile. 

At the beginning of Common Council’s meeting on Wednesday, Cole was among city employees recognized for her work in the city as a part of a quarterly performance award. She was nominated by Assistant City Attorney Catherine Muskin.

Mayor Robert Cantelmo recognized Cole reading out Muskin’s nomination, which stated Cole has remained “a consummate professional” in her work and “brings peace of mind to high stakes scenarios.”

Muskin wrote that Cole has “demanded accountability from the city” to make sure that reporting is done correctly despite the “public criticism” of the audit’s delays.

While the issues in the controller’s office underpinning the delay in the audits appear to be longstanding, council only began to focus on the issue last year. 

Alderperson Phoebe Brown, who has been in office since 2021, acknowledged to Shoen that she didn’t know how behind the city was on audits until it became a matter of public concern. 

Brown asked Shoen what the council could do to prevent the city from slipping behind on its audits again.

“I’d say the thing that the council can do more than anything else is awareness,” Shoen said. He added, “I don’t want to say that nobody was aware, but because there wasn’t more pressure, perhaps things were allowed to just get farther and farther behind.”

Before that exchange, Brown suggested in a joke that Shoen apply to fill the vacant city controller position: “We still have an opening for a controller,” she said.

Shoen laughed, marking the only moment Wednesday night that he broke from his straight-faced demeanor.
